## A brief description

I created a mobile application with cart management features as the main focus of this React Native project. The objective was to develop an application that would enable users to browse a catalog of products, put items in their carts, take them out of their carts, and store the cart's contents locally on their device.

I started by meticulously remaking the given UI mockup, constructing the required UI elements for the `HomeScreen} and `CartScreen`using a variety of React Native components. The products that were currently in the user's cart were shown on the`CartScreen`, while the `HomeScreen` showed the list of products that were available.

The app's ability to add and delete items from the cart was one of its main features. Users could manage the items in their cart by selecting the "Add to Cart" and "Remove from Cart" buttons for each product on the {HomeScreen} and the `CartScreen` respectively.

I used React Native's `AsyncStorage} API to save the cart data locally on the device in order to make sure it lasted. In order to gracefully handle any problems with data retrieval or storage, I also integrated error handling into the `AsyncStorage` procedures.

Using the `react-navigation` library, I developed an application that is both aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly, allowing users to easily switch between the `HomeScreen` and `CartScreen`.

This assignment forced me to use my understanding of and proficiency with React Native to create a useful cart management application. The process of creating the user interface, putting the main functionalities into place, and making sure the application is reliable by handling errors and storing data locally was enjoyable to me. My knowledge of React Native has grown as a result of this project, and it has also strengthened my ability to develop mobile applications that cater to actual use cases.
